 * or a person that can instantiate a workflow such as a student requesting an SPN number, 
 * that user will have a request button on the interface. The workflow programmer will 
 * specify whether a certain user type will have the functionality to start a workflow and 
 * also to be able to approve/reject incoming forms.
